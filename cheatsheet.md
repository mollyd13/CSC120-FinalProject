This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT
    Possible Commands:
            - go + north, south, east, or west to move (can only move one square at a time)
            - show inventory to print what's in your inventory
            - drop + an item from your inventory to remove an item
            - leave to exit a location
            - talk to interact with an NPC (can only be used while in a location like the park or the river)
            - grab to take an item (can only be used while in a location)
            - quit to exit the game

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

When you enter the park, enter "talk" to speak to the boy. When he gives you his mission, enter "fly to the top of the tree" to go to his ball, and "grab" to pick up the ball. You then enter "talk" again to speak to the boy and give him his ball. 

When you enter the river enter "talk" to speak to the woman. She will give you a quest to bring her bread which you can find at the store. In order to get money for the bread go to the fountain, enter "approach fountain" and "grab" until you have enough money. Then you can say "leave" to exit the fountain. When you return to the woman with bread, say "talk" to speak to her again and "give her bread" to complete the quest. 

In order to open the manhole in the secret location, buy a key from the store and return to the manhole and enter "open" and then "grab" to pick up as many worms as you want. 

To get the best ending, return to your nest with at least 2 worms.
