**Design Justification**

One of my initial ideas for the design was to have a seperate class for the NPCs, and I even thought about having a seperate class for each individual character (an OldWoman class and a Child class). These classes would store pieces of dialogue and have methods like GiveQuest() and CheckPlayerInventory(). However, I decided against this approach because it was overcomplicating everything. I realized that these NPCs should not be their own objects because they don't need any attributes and most of the methods could be simplified to System.out.println(); Also methods like CheckPlayerInventory() would require the NPC's to have access to the Pigeon object attributes which would further complicate and muddle my architecture diagram. Instead I decided to just include the dialogue in my Map class and turned the CheckInventory() function into a simple if(myPigeon.inventory.contains(item)) statement. This decision allows for the program to have less classes and take up less storage because less objects are being created. It also makes it easier to understand the program because there is less communication between different classes.
